# Magento 2 DotEnv loader

Adds support for .env configuration files to Magento 2. Variables in the .env file are used to fill in `app/etc/env.php` variables. This file can be added to source control when using this package. I think having more than one environment file is weird.

## Credits
Credits to [this package](https://github.com/Pr00xxy/magento2-dotenv) which inspired me to make this package.

## Installation
- `composer require justbetter/dotenv`
- Copy the `.env.example` [example file](Example/.env.example) to `app/etc/.env`, or. `.env` and fill in your environment variables.
- Replace the `env.php` with this [one](Example/env.php) and commit it to source control.
- `bin/magento setup:upgrade`

## Extending the environments
You can override specific environments with the APP_ENV variable in the dot env filename. [example](Example/.env.development.example). Copy the file to `app/etc/` and modify for any specified environment.

You can also load additional .env files by defining them in `LOAD_BEFORE` (allowing the values in these files to be overridden) or `LOAD_AFTER` (allowing the values in these files to override all others) with your extra .env files you would like to load.

## Disabled the writer to env.php
Because of the Writer class of magento 2 the `env.php` get rewrited every time. I disabled this functionality because the `env.php` file is not static. The cache types are not reset every time when you run `bin/magento setup:upgrade`.

## Compatibility
The module is tested on Magento version 2.4.x
